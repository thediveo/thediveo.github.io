Here are my plugins for [TiddlyWiki 5](https://www.tiddlywiki.com) (a unique
non-linear notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information).
These plugins extend your TiddlyWikis with new functionality:

- fuzzy searching
- fonts
- video player functionality and theming
- TiddlyWiki 5 plugin development

## Fuzzy Searching

## Fonts

Add fonts and icons to your TiddlyWikis without the need to install them first
into your system, or a permanent Internet connection.

personal non-linear tube uing the [Video.js media player](https://videojs.com/).
There are several skins and some feature plugins available, too.

## Plugin Development

This is from the eat-your-own-dog-food department.

[TiddlyWikiPluginSkeleton](http://thediveo.github.io/TiddlyWikiPluginSkeleton)
is a TW5 plugin skeleton project to start from when developing using the
_ThirdFlow_. This is usually the starting point, so there's no need in cloning
the _ThirdFlow_ repo, but instead clone this repository. See the project's
instructions (video, text) for details.

[ThirdFlow](http://thediveo.github.io/ThirdFlow) helps with developing
TiddlyWiki plugins: it neatly organizes your tiddlers for perfect source code
management, packages your plugins, and generates live demo Wikis.
