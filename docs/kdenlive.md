Some stuff that might come in handy when working with the Open Source
[Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) non-linear video editor.

## 💤Project Analyzer

A [Kdenlive project
analyzer](http://thediveo.github.io/kdenlive-project-analyzer), built from a
crazy HTML5-XSLT combo. Checks your Kdenlive XML project files and sheds some
lights on this angle brackets soup.

## 💤Post-Render Script

The [Kdenlive Post-Render
Script](https://github.com/TheDiveO/kdenlive-post-render-script) adds meta data
and cover art to freshly rendered MP4 video files.
