# The Lost VSCode Ctrl-Click

Lost Ctrl-Click to not go anywere and also no visual feedback to be seen? Still
hoping to getting actually working advice on that "radish" forum?

- <key>Ctrl</key>+<key>P</key>, "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
- remove the setting `"editor.multiCursorModifier": "ctrlCmd"
